# FloodIt
FloodIt is a game format that is very popular for cellphones with more than 1M downloads in Android(of course I didn't invent it). I chose to do this project since when I thought about it, I could not find a way to do it.
Once I figured it out, more ideas came to my mind and I started adding them. With this project I learned a lot about Swing like using LayoutManagers in addition to other 
miscellanous things like reading/writing files, playing sounds, and a long etcetera. 
It's about ~3100 lines of code without counting the classes in the icon package since those were not written by me. I'm 
using the JTattoo library for the app's looks.

Most of the code variables, classes, comments, packages are in Spanish since I'm from Argentina.

Thanks for reading!
