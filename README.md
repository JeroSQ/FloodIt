# FloodIt
FloodIt is a game that is very popular for cellphones with more than 1M downloads. I chose to do this project since when I thought about it, I could not find a way to do it.
Once I figured it out, more ideas came to my mind and I started adding them. With this project I learned a lot about Swing like using LayoutManagers in addition to other 
miscellanous things like reading/writing files, playing sounds, and a long etcetera. 
The code isn't extremely clean, but it isn't a mess either. It's about ~3100 lines without counting the classes in the icon package since those were not written by me. I'm 
using the JTattoo library for the app's looks.

Note: Keep in mind I only started programming roughly 2 months ago so I'm still learning good practices, and I can see many ways of improving the code. However, I'm not going to
do that since I'd like to continue learning other languages and stuff, and this project has taken lots of time, which sadly, I don't have lots of right now. 
Most of the code variables, classes, comments, packages are in Spanish since I'm from Argentina.

Thanks for reading!
